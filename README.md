# 🥀 YouTube Sponsor Remover 😭

**Deletes the first sponsored item from the YouTube homepage every 1 second.**  
Perfect for staying emotionally unstable *without* getting hit with "Sponsored" vibes 😭✌️

## 💾 How to Use

1. **Download the ZIP file** from this repo
2. Extract the ZIP into a folder (anywhere u want 🥺)
3. Open **Chrome** and go to 👉 `chrome://extensions/`
4. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right corner)
5. Click **“Load unpacked”**
6. Select the folder u extracted earlier 💖

That's it — the extension will now run in the background and remove any sponsored content from your homepage every 1 second 😭🙏

## ⚙️ What it Does

- Looks inside every `ytd-rich-item-renderer` on the YouTube homepage
- If it finds a tag that says **"Sponsored"** in it:
  - It deletes that entire item 🥀
  - Only deletes one at a time, so it's gentle 😭

Runs every 1 second so even if YouTube reloads stuff in — it still slays 💅

## 🧠 Why tho

because we're tired of getting emotionally manipulated *and* advertised to at the same time 💔😭

## 📂 Files

- `manifest.json` → chrome extension manifest
- `remove.js` → main script that deletes sponsored stuff
